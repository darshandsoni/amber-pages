# Amber Pages
Amber pages is an open-source beers directory. It lists beers with useful information for the common person who is travelling and just wants to grab a decent, social pint. Amber pages is powered by the [Jalibut](https://github.com/darshandsoni/jalibut) framework.

## Why?
You find yourself in random places when you travel and you just want to have a social pint at a local pub. You can start searching for stuff online, but you quickly run into opening a tonne of tabs on your poor mobile device, or have to mentally process largely varying information.
At the other end of the spectrum, maybe you find a dedicated beer blog, but wait... it features exotic hipster stuff that is rare to come by, describes pretentious "bouquets" and has no relevance to the commoner's craving for their decent pint. And then you have beer apps... suffices to say that you should not dedicate 10-50MB on your phone and a precious parking space on your apps menu for a dedicated beer app... just find one site and have it efficiently load your beers for you!

## How does it work?
Amber pages has a large (soon to be) and growing list of common beers in many countries. It very briefly describes them with plain terms to help you decide what you'd like to drink / order for your mates.
The best thing is that you can just start typing the country you're in, the type of beer you want, the ABV, a particular flavour... just start typing and get your order in quickly!

## Contributing
This project is made to aid your decision making. But your contributions are just as valuable, to make others lives easier when they are pint hunting. Contributing is as simple as adding a line to the beers.js file. Detailed instructions and an automated line generator (because writing JSON is a chore) will be published soon!
